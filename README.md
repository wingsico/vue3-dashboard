I named this project **`Oka`**.

Because my girlfriend chatted with me when I created the project and said the egg yolk toast at the school gate was too delicious, so I used the Hawaiian word for egg yolk **`Oka`** as the name of the project.



This code base uses `Vite` and `Vue3` to build a dashboard project, and includes some server-side APIs in the project. The language used by the dashboard project is `Typescript`, which is a modern, typed superset language of `JavaScript`.

If nothing happens, **the project will be updated every night between 9-11 until I finish the project**
